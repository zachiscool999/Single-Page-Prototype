        Pong is widely recognized as the first video game to achieve commercial
        success, becoming a cornerstone of the video game industry. It was
        developed by the Atari co-founder, Allan Alcorn. Pong was released in
        1972 but orginally was not inteded to be a major product. It was
        actually just a simple training excersize for Alcorn to help him learn
        the basics of game design.
